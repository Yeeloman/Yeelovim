# Yeelovim - The Custome Experience

the following project is still work in progress, it aims to provide the new vim users with a simple, and configurable nvim setup.
Yeelovim comes with a preconfigured setup that you can build on top of it and it's easy to wrap your head around it.

## Requirements

* Neovim >= 0.9.0 (needs to be built with LuaJIT)
* Git >= 2.19.0 (for partial clones support)
* a Nerd Font(v3.0 or greater) (optional, but needed to display some icons)
* lazygit (optional)
* a C compiler for nvim-treesitter. 

## Installation

Start create a backup for your current nvim files:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
```

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yeeloman/Yeelovim ~/.config/nvim
```

you can start Yeelovim now:

```bash
nvim
```

## Starter Plugins:

I'll add the list of plugins later

## TODO:

* I be trying to configure nvim-DAP so you don't have to 
* Create HUSH theme for Yeelovim
* configure whichkey display to be more easy to understand
* finally make a better readme than this one

#### theres an error that displays sometimes when opening a lua file, still cant figure out how to fix it, if you have any idea hit me up THANK YOU.
